An interface is similar to a class. An interface is a collection of abstract methods and a class implements  an interface
Along with abstract methods, an interface may contain:
 - constants,
 - Default methods,
 - Static Methods,
 - Nested types
Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods.

Tagging interface:
    - This is an interface without methods.
    1. Creates a common parent. => used to create a common parent among a group of interfaces
    2. Adds a data type to a class. => a class implementing a tagging interface does not need to define methods but the class becomes an interface type through polymorphism
